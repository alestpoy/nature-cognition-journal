## Observation Focus
Soundscape Analysis: A 10‑Minute Listening Session

## Observations (Flora/Fauna)
- **Trees:** English oak (*Quercus robur*) with russet leaves still clinging; silver birch (*Betula pendula*) with yellowing foliage.
- **Birds:** Several European robins (*Erithacus rubecula*) singing short, melodic phrases. A pair of magpies (*Pica pica*) chattering in the distance.
- **Ground cover:** Patches of ivy (*Hedera helix*) covering tree bases; fallen leaves creating a damp, multi‑coloured carpet.
- **Insect:** One late‑season bumblebee (*Bombus terrestris*) foraging on a remaining ivy flower.

## Sensory Details
### Sounds
*10‑minute focused listening with eyes closed:*

1. **Natural sounds**
   - Robin song: clear, high‑pitched, repetitive phrases about every 10–15 seconds. The rhythm felt like a heartbeat.
   - Wind through leaves: a soft, rustling whisper that rose and fell with gust cycles.
   - Distant crow calls: two or three harsh “caws” from the tree line.
   - Drizzle on jacket hood: a steady, fine pattering, almost white‑noise‑like.
   - Squirrel movement: faint scratching and rustling in the leaf litter.

2. **Human‑made sounds**
   - Far‑off traffic hum: a low, constant background from the North Circular Road.
   - Occasional aircraft overhead: a high‑frequency drone that slowly faded.
   - Voices of walkers: muffled conversations passing about 50 m away, laughter echoing briefly.

3. **Temporal pattern**
   - First 3 minutes: dominant sounds were wind and traffic.
   - Minutes 4–7: robin song became more prominent as I tuned in.
   - Final minutes: drizzle intensified, masking distant sounds; the robin stopped singing.

### Smells
- Wet earth and decaying leaves – a rich, loamy scent.
- A faint hint of wood‑smoke from a nearby chimney.
- The clean, ozonic smell of recent rain.

### Visual & Tactile
- *Eyes closed*, but before closing: grey sky, muted colours of autumn, trees swaying slightly.
- Tactile: cold, damp air on face; occasional drizzle droplets on hands; rough bark of the oak I leaned against.
- Temperature: cool but not uncomfortable; wind chill noticeable on ears.

## Cognitive / Emotional Reflection
**Before the session:** I arrived feeling slightly anxious about an upcoming deadline, my mind jumping between tasks.

**During the 10 minutes:** The act of “just listening” forced me to drop my internal narrative. At first, I kept mentally labelling sounds (“that’s a robin, that’s a car”). After about four minutes, the labels faded and I began to hear the soundscape as a whole – a layered texture of rhythms and pitches. The robin’s song became a anchor point, something to return to when my thoughts wandered.

**Cognitive shifts:**
- **Attention:** My focus moved from directed (task‑oriented) to soft, open awareness. This aligns with the concept of *involuntary attention* in Attention Restoration Theory – nature provides fascinating but gentle stimuli that allow directed‑attention fatigue to recover.
- **Time perception:** Ten minutes felt much longer than expected, yet not tedious. The slow change in sound layers made me feel present in the moment rather than rushing through it.
- **Emotional tone:** The initial anxiety softened into a calm, almost melancholic acceptance. The drizzle and grey sky, which I might have found depressing earlier, now felt soothing and appropriate.

**After the session:** I opened my eyes and the visual world seemed sharper, colours slightly more vivid. The mental “chatter” was quieter. I walked away with a sense of clarity and a renewed patience for the day’s work.

## Personal Notes & Questions
- Would the soundscape differ dramatically on a sunny, windy day? I plan to return in different weather to compare.
- How much of the traffic hum is always present but normally filtered out? Our auditory habituation is powerful.
- Could recording the session and analysing the frequency spectrum reveal patterns I missed?
